    "The perceptron is a machine learning algorithm that is used to make classifications between two different binary outcomes, $\\{-1,1\\}$. It has a rich history in neuroscience and AI. Here's a [video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNxadbrN_aI) of it from the 1950's! Here we provide an introduction to the perceptron algorithm. Later will be adapt the perceptron so that it more closely resembles neurons in the brain."
